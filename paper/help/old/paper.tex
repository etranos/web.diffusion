\section{Introduction}\label{sec:1}}

Geographers were always interested in how new technologies and
innovations diffuse across space and, importantly, how such
spatio-temporal processes can be modelled. The seminal contribution of
{[}1{]} is illustrative of this early interest. However, the torch of
exploring and modelling such processes had been passed to other
disciplines such as economics, business studies and sociology well
before the `cultural turn' of economic geography {[}2{]}. A potential
explanation of lack of studies exploring the diffusion of new and, more
specifically, digital technologies across \emph{both} space and time can
be attributed to the scarcity of relevant and granular enough data. As
{[}3{]} highlight, digital activities are hardly ever captured in
official data.

This paper aims to reinstate geographers' interest in how new and
digital technologies diffuse over space and time. It adopts a geographic
standpoint to explore and map the diffusion of web technologies in the
UK over space and time. It does so by employing a novel source of big
data which captures the active engagement with web technologies during
the \(1996-2013\) period.

The motivation for this paper lies in the fact that there are various
stakeholders who are interested in knowing how new digital technologies
diffused over space and time use this information to make predictions
regarding the diffusion of related future technologies. As per {[}4{]} a
variety of actors have a direct interest in gaining such knowledge
including network equipment suppliers; network operators, regulatory and
local authorities. And despite the spatial heterogeneity of such
diffusion mechanisms and the policy relevance, there are very limited
attempts in the literature to analyse the diffusion of new digital
technologies at a granular level.

the paper answers an empirical question: how did a

{[}3{]} Because new digital activities are rarely---if ever---captured
in official state data, researchers must rely on information gathered
from alternative sources. With this in mind, the overarching aim of this
article is outlining an approach for analyzing the ``new spaces and
geographies'' of digital phenomena and practices.

{[}4{]} There are numerous agents who would benefit from accurate
predictions of introduction times. These include: suppliers of network
equipment for production planning; suppliers of mobile phones who need
to have inventories of appropriately configured handsets; international
network planners who need to provide sufficient bandwidth for
communications between different countries; network operators and
regulatory authorities.

Classifying adopters of a technology along a time axis was pioneered by
Rogers (1962), who categorized adopters into five groups as innovators,
early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards.

An a priori approach groups similar countries into segments, where
similarity is defined using economic, social, or political covariates.
Examples include Hofstede (2001) and Lee (1990). An a posteriori
analysis considers segments based on realized market behaviour, for
example see Sood et al.~(2009). Some studies investigate changing
segment membership over time, see Cannon and Yaprak (2011).

{[}5{]} Hägerstrand (1952, 1967) was the first scholar to intensively
analyze spatial diffusion pro cesses. Based on the empirical
observations of the regional spread of process innovations, he
hypothesized that new technology is first implemented in the `center' --
the large agglom erations -- and then moves `down' the spatial
hierarchy, the last stop being the `periphery', i.e.~remote and sparsely
populated regions. There are at least two factors that may explain this
pattern: first, the transfer of tacit knowledge via face-to-face contact
and second, the absorptive capacity of a region.

{[}6{]} The concept of absorptive capacity has also been applied in the
TIS context in terms of the con-struction of capacity needed to transfer
and implement a new technology in the receiving country (cf.Van Alphen,
2011), with repercussions for the nature of system functions

{[}7{]} larger local technological niches (at least from a demand
perspective) are more likely to be formed in urban areas than in rural
ones, which is in line with the work of Ha¨gerstrand (1965a,b). However,
size is not the only regional characteristic that may matter in this
context. Regions also differ in accumulated experiences and the presence
of tacit knowledge with respect to products, as well as in actors'
propensity share this knowledge among producers (Martin et al., 2019)

To summarize the discussion, first, here the diffusion process is
selfperpetuating as initial use stimulates further use. Second, it
follows a disequilibrium path as the level of users is always lower than
the number of potential users (Stoneman 2002).

The criticisms are mainly based on the fact that although the approach
gives an idea of aggregate (industry or household) behaviour, it does
not focus on the individual's (firm or household) adoption process

{[}8{]} Spatial diffusion is the process by which behavior or
characteristics of the landscape change as a result of what happens
elsewhere earlier. Spatial diffusion is the spread of the phenomenon,
over space and timed, from limited origins

Contagious diffusion=\textgreater{} spatial autocorelation

expansion-type diffusion

The work by the communication sociologist Everett Rogers (1962, 1971,
1983) has emphasized the role of information, communication, formal and
informal media, opinion leaders and social networks, and economic and
psychological constraints on acceptance. Rogers's work stresses the
decision mechanism of the potential adopter; the work of Rogers
partitions the adopter's process of choosing to accept a new phenomenon
or trait into five stages: stage 1--the potential adopter gains
knowledge or awareness of an innovation; stage 2--persuasion is
exercised to adopt; stage 3--a decision is made to adopt; stage 4--the
decision to adopt is implemented; stage 5--the adopter confirms the
decision to adopt. In Rogers's stage theory there may be a substantial
time lag between when a potential adopter becomes aware of the new
characteristic and when a decision is actually made to adopt.

Hägerstrand considered diffusion to be a fundamental geographic process:
Whatever the phenomenon being diffused might be, one may consider it in
the context of a larger universal process of spatial diffusion.

{[}9{]} Diffusion is a spatial (Hagerstrand, 1967) as well as a temporal
process, and historical evidence confirms that technologies diffuse at
different times, at different rates, and to different extents in
different places, and can be significantly influenced by policies
(Victor, 1993).

Lastly, it can be globally optimal for innovative economies to deploy
advanced technologies more than what is locally optimal if this enables
faster diffusion in less advanced regions that could benefit from the
technology.

wilson201281 Early on in their lifecycle, new technologies are crude,
imperfect, and expensive (Rosenberg, 1994). New energy technologies are
attractive for their ability to perform a particular task or deliver a
new or improved energy service (Fouquet, 2010). This is often
circumscribed by a particular set of needs in a particular context: a
market `niche'. End-users in niche markets are generally less sensitive
to the effective price of the energy service provided or have a higher
willingness to pay for its performance advantages (Fouquet, 2010). Thus
initially, performance dominates cost competitiveness (Wilson and
Grubler, 2011). Market niches afford some protection from competitive
pressures, allowing technologies to be tested and improved in applied
settings, reducing uncertainties with performance or market demand (Kemp
et al., 1998). Costs may only fall substantively after an extended
period of commercial experimentation, concurrent with the establishment
of an industrial base and characteristic moves towards standardisation
and mass production (Grubler, 1998). The influence of accumulating
production experience on costs is captured by the concept of learning.

grubler1990rise The scale of spatial innovation diffusion is similar to
that of temporal diffusion models: hierarchically decomposed.

{[}10{]} Later Hagerstrand conceptualized physical ``barrier'' effects
like lakes or uninhabited areas, which, in addition to distance, act as
further retarding effects on diffusion. These are formalized in the form
of ``zero'' or ``half'' contact multiplicators on the (distance
decaying) message flows.

{[}10{]} With respect to the formalization of the communication flows
Hagerstrand defines a ``mean information field'' (MIF), in which the
probability of communication is a negative function of distance between
individuals

{[}2{]} Theoretical models disagree as to why firms adopt innovations at
different times. Epidemic models emphasize information (Griliches 1957).
Certain firms are hypothesized to adopt earlier because they come into
contact with, and learn from, adopters of the new technology before
others. Economic models, on the other hand, predominantly emphasize firm
heterogeneity (Ireland and Stoneman 1986). Firms adopt technologies at
different times because they differ with respect to various
organizational and environmental variables influencing the economic
returns from adoption (Blackman 1999).

Either way, the strong assumption is that developing countries can
acquire modern technology innovated in developed economies, often at a
fraction of the original research and development (R\&D) costs, thereby
leapfrogging many decades of technological progress (Teece 2000).

The first involves a country's geographical location. Recent empirical
work suggests that diffusion is `'geographically localized'' (Globerman,
Kokko, and Sjo¨holm 2000; Keller 2002; Milner 2003) in that a technology
diffuses faster in a country where it is already more widely diffused in
neighboring countries. Underlying these regional effects are contagion
and contact with prior users or producers of technology.

{[}11{]} Rogers (1995) characterized early adopters as knowledgeable
risk takers. Griliches (1957) looked at the rate of return for early
adopters and characterized them as profit maximizers. The geographer
Hagerstrand (1967) was focusing on the character of early adopters in
the transmittal process that produces follow-on participants in the
process. Space was treated as a contiguity system with embedded
characteristics producing barrier elements to the diffusion process.

{[}11{]} REVIEW ON Technological Diffusion

{[}12{]} Two main mechanisms are identified in the literature to explain
diffusion: (1) epidemic-type dynamics whereby contact with previous
adopters stimulates uptake as po tential adopters learn about a new
innovation; and (2) economic-type mechanisms whereby potential users
adopt a new innovation as it be comesmore profitable, useful, or
valuable, with uptake characteristically spreading as costs be come
lower, performance improves, or the po tential uses of the innovation
grow over time.

To this extent, our results contribute to a growing body of work that
has sought to caution against claims about the supposed novelty of the
Internet and the suggestion that it is somehow different.

{[}13{]} Logistic growth describes an initial period of gradual
diffusion as a technology is introduced as a new commercial application,
moving then through a rapid, exponential growth phase, before slowing
and eventually saturating {[}14{]}. The substitution of incumbent
technologies by new competitors leads to subsequent decline and eventual
obsolescence.

{[}15{]} To characterize evolution of the computer industry, we examine
the distribution of relative employment across cities in 1977 and how
that distribution changes over time to 1992

There is no tendency of relative size distributions of urban computer
employment to collapse, go bimodal, or fully spread. Overall computers
exhibit some turbulence, with dramatic big winners and losers among
cities. In attracting or repelling an industry, urban heterogeneity is
important. Large, well educated cities near San Jose have much greater
chances of attracting high-tech employment and less of losing it

{[}7{]} spatial innovation diffusion By using Bayesian survival models
with time-dependent data of wind turbine deployment and firm foundation
for 402 German regions between the years 1970 and 2015, we show that the
spatial evolution of the German wind energy industry was more strongly
influenced by local demand-- pull than local supply--push processes.

The industry's initial locations are distributed relatively arbitrarily
and unpredictably, as their needs in terms of resources and skills are
diverse and distinct from the older existing industries (Boschma and
Lambooy, 1999). Consequently, emerging industries are characterized by
relatively high degrees of freedom in terms of location. In later
extensions of the concept, the assumption of the randomness of locations
was revised with greater importance assigned to regional conditions
(Boschma and Lambooy, 1999; Fornahl et al., 2012).

{[}2{]} analyze whether the rate at which new producer technologies
diffuse is significantly influenced by (1) latecomer advantage and (2)
engagement with the global economy via trade and foreign investment

Indeed, precisely because of these latecomer advantages, developing
countries1 are believed to be well placed to catch up with developed
ones (Gerschenkron 1962; Abramovitz 1986).

{[}5{]} analyze the spatial diffusion of laser technology research in
West Germany from 1960, when this technology began, until 2005.

{[}12{]}

{[}16{]} We see that the OSN spread almost exclusively from the original
location (the capital Budapest, with an order of magnitude more
inhabitants than the next size town) to various parts of the country in
the early phase of the life-cycle. Later, diffusion became less
mono-centric and other towns also emerged as spreaders. Our findings
support the idea that spreading initially happens to large distances and
becomes more local over time. This is illustrated and discussed later in
Figure 2I.

{[}17{]}

{[}9{]} for energy There is no generally accepted theory that explains
diffusion rate heterogeneity across technologies, but several factors
are considered important. Greater unit scale and larger market size
contribute to slower diffusion. Requirements for interrelated
technologies or complex infrastructures also hinder the diffusion
process (Grubler, 2012).

Mobile phones benefited from early deployment in recreational boats and
automobiles, where the traditional competitor was not a viable option.
In the early stages of diffusion, performance is a more important driver
of adoption than cost competitiveness. Typically, significant cost
reductions only occur once the technology reaches a deployment level
capable of supporting standardization and mass production (Wilson,
2012).

{[}9{]} Empirical evidence supports the validity of Schmidt's Law over a
wide range of technologies, time periods, and geographical contexts. A
recent meta-analysis of technology up-scaling found that diffusion
accelerated moving from the core to the rim and periphery for
technologies as diverse as natural gas power, oil refineries, and
automobiles (Wilson, 2009). One historical example that conforms
particularly well to Schmidt's Law is the diffusion of coal power in
Europe (Grubler, 2012). England emerged as the core region for coal
power because it had legal and economic institutions that incentivized
scientific pursuits, domestic coal reserves, and a clear industrial
motivation to replace water power with coal. \ldots{}

{[}11{]} model the spatial diffusion of mobile telecommunications in
China as well as its determinants. regional socioeconomic
characteristics play an important role in determining the timing, speed,
and level of mobile telecommunications diffusion in China

{[}18{]} explore What determines the duration of formative phases for
energy innovations in different markets? We are interested both in
initial markets (also: core, lead, first mover, early adopter) where
formative phases prepare technologies for mass commercialization, and in
follower markets (also: periphery, lag, late adopter) where accelerated
formative phases may benefit from diffusion and spillovers.
