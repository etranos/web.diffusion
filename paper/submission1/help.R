## Old ideas

Hexagon density maps: reflect the spatial structure of Britain. Websites
are associated in places where people live and work.

**TODO** maps at the local authority level per firms and discuss
patterns

Neighbourhood effect: diffusion proceeds outwards from innovation
centers, first "hitting" nearby rather than far-away locations (Grubler
                                                                1990)

-   Moran's I: for OA and LAD over time

-   LISA maps: for OA and LAD over time More and less expected clusters.
    Different scales show different results

-   Website density regressions: for OA and LAD over time **TODO** add
    0s Similar pattern

Hierarchy effect: from main centers to secondary ones -- central places

-   Gini coefficient. Almost perfect polarisation of web adoption in the
    early stages at a granular level More equally diffused at the Local
    Authority level Plateau overtime

S-shaped diffusion curves

-   S for LADs per firm and OA.

-   Fast and slow LAs map. There is clustering

-   s_uk_firm_11

-   ranks: there is stability and movement
