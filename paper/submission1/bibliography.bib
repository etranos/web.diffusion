abstract = {Our research objective was to undertake a longitudinally study of how technologies and practices used in web development diffuse over time and whether the diffusion patterns are affected by the regions or the industries in which they take place. The diffusion of web technologies is of interest as, they are highly visible and accessible across the globe and industries by their very nature, which makes it possible to potential adopters to trial them and experience first-hand their relative advantage, compatibility and complexity. Three different cases were chosen, in order to test our hypotheses based on the Diffusion of Innovations Theory. A system was built to collect data using the Wayback Machine. The data collected covered a period of 13years. Our findings suggest that web innovations may diffuse differently when compared to each other, but also when regions and sectors are considered. Beyond testing the ecological validity of Diffusion of Innovations Theory in web-related technologies, our findings have practical implications which can inform the diffusion of technologies and standards.}

A breakdown of the types of business represented shows that whilst computing companies continue to have a sizeable presence on the web, certain other types of business now also have a relatively large number of sites. The survey found many media-related businesses and professional-based companies and practices, reflecting the increasing use of Information Technology in these areas but also the increasing knowledge about the Internet that is needed or helpful in many types of job. The results are consistent with general business use of the web in the UK still being in an experimental phase of web site creation by those who can rather than by those who should.}
