\begin{abstract}
This paper maps the participation in the digital economy and its
evolution in the UK over space and time. Most of the existing economic
geography literature which dealt with the spatiality of the internet
employed supply-side measures, such as infrastructural capacity, in
order to understand the geography of the digital economy and its
potential spatial economic effects. Useful as these approaches might
have been, they cannot capture the micro-processes and the
characteristics of the individual online behaviour. Using large volumes
of archived and geolocated web content, this paper models the diffusion
of web technologies over space and time in the UK. The data and
geolocation strategy allow to capture these processes at a very granular
spatial scale. The modelling approach, which is based on simple spatial
analytical methods and on the estimation of diffusion curves at various
scales, enables to depict the role of geography and other cognitive
factors which drove the diffusion of web technologies. Although the
focus is on a recent historical period -- 1996-2012 -- the results of
the analysis depict diffusion mechanisms which can be very useful in
understanding the evolutionary patterns of the adoption of other newer
technologies.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}}

Geographers were always interested in how new technologies and
innovations diffuse across space and, importantly, how such
spatio-temporal processes can be modelled. After all, diffusion together
with invention and innovation are considered the pillars of
technological change \citep{das2022diffusion}. The seminal contribution
of \citet{hagerstrand1968innovation} is illustrative of this early
interest. However, the torch of exploring and modelling such processes
had been passed to other disciplines such as economics, business studies
and sociology well before the `cultural turn' of economic geography
\citep{perkins2005international}. A potential explanation of the lack of
geographical studies exploring the diffusion of new and, more
specifically, digital technologies across \emph{both} space and time can
be attributed to the scarcity of relevant and granular enough data. As
\citet{zook2022mapping} highlight, digital activities are hardly ever
captured in official data.

This paper offers such a contribution: a geographical study illustrating
how a new technology that is the web diffused over space and time in the
UK at a high level of spatial granularity during the \(1996-2012\)
period. It does so by employing a novel source of big data which
captures the active engagement with web technologies during that period.
By addressing this empirical question this paper exemplifies how the
combination of data sources which escape the traditional social science
domain and adequate research methods can offer new contributions
regarding our understanding of how new technologies diffuse.

The motivation for this paper lies in the fact that there are various
stakeholders who are interested in knowing how new digital technologies
diffused over space and time and use this information to make
predictions regarding the diffusion of related \emph{future}
technologies. As per \citet{leibowicz2016representing}, historical
studies agree on the fact that ``technologies diffuse at different
times, at different rates, and to different extents in different places,
and can be significantly influenced by policies \citep{victor1993}''.
\citet{meade2021modelling} highlight that a variety of actors have a
direct interest in gaining such knowledge including network equipment
suppliers; network operators, regulatory and local authorities. These
processes and their effects very a lot between scales: although the
diffusion of a new technology might not be optimal at a local level, it
might be beneficial from a global perspective as it could lead to faster
diffusion to less advantaged places \citep{leibowicz2016representing}.
Despite the spatial heterogeneity of such diffusion mechanisms and the
policy relevance, there are very limited attempts in the literature to
analyse the diffusion of new digital technologies at a detailed
geographical level.

Technological diffusion, which is by definition an aggregated process,
can be discussed in parallel with individual adoption mechanisms. On the
one hand, \citet{rogers2010diffusion} identifies early adopter of new
technologies as `knowledgeable risk takers' and \citet{griliches1957} as
`profit maximisers' \citep{ding2010modeling}. Such individual agents are
rewarded because of their attitude towards new technologies and
innovations. On the other hand, \citet{perkins2011internet} attribute
diffusion to two processes: (i) epidemic-like mechanisms, which are
governed by distance, proximity and social interactions, and (ii) by
economic mechanisms as new innovations are adopted by users as they
become more profitable, valueable and useful.

This paper focuses on the diffusion of the web as new technology during
the \(1996-2012\) period. This was an exciting period for digital
technologies as it corresponds with the commercialisation of the
internet and, consequently, its almost universal adoption. The reader is
reminded that it was only in 1994 when Netscape Navigator was
introduced, a year before Microsoft's Internet Explorer \footnote{\url{https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/22/web-browser-came-back-haunt-microsoft}}.
Also, only \(9\) per cent of UK's households had access to the internet
in \(1998\) \citep{ons2018} and during that period that web included
mostly static webpages, there were no social media and web browsing was
happening exclusively from desktop PCs as there were no smartphones
\citep{tranosuk}. Hence, it is fair to say that the study period
captures the very early stages of the diffusion on a new technology that
is the web. This is key point in the lifecycle of a new technology.
Firstly, during this period new technologies are expensive, crude and
imperfect \citep{rosenberg1994exploring, wilson201281}. A simple
comparison between Web 1.0 and Web 3.0 applications clearly illustrates
this \citep{tranos2020social}. During this period the performance of a
new technology is the main attraction and not the cost to access and use
it \citep{wilson2011lessons} There is a broader theoretical discussion
in the literature regarding the motivation behind early adoption. As
summarised by \citet{perkins2005international}, on the one hand,
epidemic models highlight the role of interpersonal contacts as a way
for new technologies to diffuse. On the other hand, economic models
underline the importance of heterogeneity. Different firms have
different structures and business plans, which define the potential
economic returns of the adoption of a new technology and, therefore, the
choice to adopt a new technology becomes an individual option. From a
broader and evolutionary perspective, initial conditions are essential
for the creation and evolution of path-dependent technological
development trajectories \citep{neffke2011regions, simmie2014new}. This
argument is even more relevant when the focus is on Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) because of the commonly found lag
between investment and economic returns as reflected in the Solow
paradox \citep{acemoglu2014return, brynjolfsson2018artificial}.

Importantly, the data used here depicts the \emph{active} engagement
with the web as it contains all the commercial websites archived by the
Internet Archive \footnote{\href{See\%20https://archive.org/}{https://archive.org/}.}
that include a mention to at least one valid UK postcode in the web
text. Websites are identified as commercial ones if they are part of the
.co.uk second level domain (SLD). Also, the act of of creating a website
is understood here as active engagement with the web vis-à-vis the more
passive act of browsing the web or having an internet connection
\citep{tranosuk}. Previous studies have focused mostly on more passive
notions of engaging with digital technologies such as internet adoption
and internet speeds
\citep[e.g.][]{blank2018local, riddlesden2014broadband}.

\citet{grubler1990rise} Later Hagerstrand conceptualized physical
``barrier'' effects like lakes or uninhabited areas, which, in addition
to distance, act as further retarding effects on diffusion. These are
formalized in the form of ``zero'' or ``half'' contact multiplicators on
the (distance decaying) message flows.

\citet{grubler1990rise} With respect to the formalization of the
communication flows Hagerstrand defines a ``mean information field''
(MIF), in which the probability of communication is a negative function
of distance between individuals

\citet{wilson201281} Logistic growth describes an initial period of
gradual diffusion as a technology is introduced as a new commercial
application, moving then through a rapid, exponential growth phase,
before slowing and eventually saturating \citep{grubler1999dynamics}.
The substitution of incumbent technologies by new competitors leads to
subsequent decline and eventual obsolescence.

\section{Literature review}\label{sec2}}

Geographical diffusion is a synthesis of different processes. On the one
hand, we can identify purely spatial or, in other words, contagious
processes. Adjacency and, more broadly, distance are the key drivers of
diffusion. This perspective draws similarities with epidemics:
innovation just like pathogens spreads because of contagion and,
consequently, proximity and exposure \citep{hivner2003facilitating}. On
the other hand, we can identify hierarchical processes. Instead of
horizontal distance-based diffusion mechanisms, the top-down hierarchy
of urban systems drives diffusion. In reality, the synthesis of these
two processes represents how new technologies diffuse over space and
time \citep{morrill2020spatial}.

These ideas were firstly introduced by Torsten Hägerstrand and his
thesis entitled `Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial Process'
\citep{hagerstrand1968innovation}. Hägerstrand was the first one to
identify diffusion as a geographical process. The starting point was the
idea that diffusion is based on passing information through social
networks, which themselves tend to be defined by geography. Hence, he
identified the `neighbourhood' effect of how information, and
consequently, innovation diffuse. He used agricultural innovations to
test and model his ideas using Monte Carlo simulations. Hägerstrand also
incorporated the role of hierarchy and how some phenomena maybe firstly
adopted in larger cities and then diffuse to second tier ones. This is a
sequential instead of a simultaneous process, which resembles the
`lead-lag' spatial acceleration effect in market research
\citep{bento2018time, PERES201091}. Hägerstrand maybe more widely known
for highlighting the role time plays in the diffusion of innovations: an
early-pioneering period, a middle fast accelerating period and a final
saturation one {[}\citet{morrill2020spatial}.

The temporal dimension was further explored by Everett Rogers and his
seminal work on `Diffusion of Innovations' \citep{rogers2010diffusion}.
Rogers being a sociologist his work focused not on the diffusion of
innovations over space and time, but instead on the adoption of new
technologies and innovations by individuals and the individual
mechanisms that drive the decisions behind adoption. He identified five
groups of individuals regarding their adoption speed: innovators, early
adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. Key mechanism of
diffusion and adoption is always communication and how knowledge is
transferred within a social system. Therefore, all approaches agree on
the S-shaped diffusion and cumulative adoption pattern
\citep{grubler1990rise}.

Schmidt's Law empirically illustrates a similar pattern. \emph{Core} and
usually highly agglomerated regions is where new technologies are
invented and commercially deployed {[}\citet{grubler1990rise};
grubler1990rise{]}. This is where the first adopters tend to be based.
Then, technologies spread to the \emph{rim} and eventually to the
\emph{periphery}. Although adoption pace might be higher when new
technologies finally arrive to the periphery, the saturation levels
there may never reach the ones in the core because of the lack of
infrastructure or other necessary institutions
\citep{leibowicz2016representing}. \citet{grubler1990rise} effectively
summarises the three key characteristics of the spatial diffusion
process: (i) the cumulative level of adoption follows an S-shaped
pattern just like purely temporal models; (ii) diffusion is shaped by a
hierarchy effect in a form of a centrifugal force: from core to
periphery; and (iii) diffusion is also shaped by distance and a
neighbourhood effect and contaminate nearby locations.

The remaining of this section reviews empirical studies which analysed
the diffusion on new technologies over space and time. Although the
spatial dimension is present in most of the following studies, the level
of spatial detail is almost always more coarse than the one adopted
here. To begin with \citet{beardsell1999spatial} studied the evolution
of the computer industry in \(317\) US metro areas during the
\(1977-1992\) period using employment data. Their analysis indicated
that the relative size distribution holds for urban computer employment
and also urban heterogeneity is essential in explaining this
distribution. \citet{bednarz2020pulled} focused on wind turbines and
modelled their spatial diffusion across \(402\) German regions during
\(1970-2015\). Their key finding is that local demand than local supply
was the main driving factor.

At a global scale \citet{perkins2005international} analyzed if the
diffusion rate of new technologies is driven by a latecomer advantage
and the engagement with the global economy via foreign direct
investments and trade. Their results illustrate that indeed latecomers
and developing countries experience diffusion of new technologies more
rapidly than early adopter and developed countries. At the same scale,
\citet{perkins2011internet} explored whether the adoption of previous
communication technologies that is mail, telegrams and telephones was
shaped by similar socioeconomic factors as the internet. Their results
indicated common patterns regarding the drivers behind the adoption of
different communication technologies.

Turning to studies that share more technological and scalar similarities
with this paper, \citet{ding2010modeling} modelled the spatial diffusion
of mobile telecommunications across regions in China. Their analysis
indicated that socioeconomic characteristics are important determinants
of the timing, speed and the level of mobile diffusion within China.
Using data from a Hungarian online social network,
\citet{lengyel2020role} analysed its adoption and the churn at a very
granular spatial level. Their results are in agreement with early
theoretical and empirical contributions reviewed here: assortativity,
urban scaling and distance are the key drivers of spatial diffusion. At
a global scale \citet{PAPAGIANNIDIS2015308} modelled the diffusion of
different web technologies technologies and practices. Interestingly,
they did so by using similar, but less extensive data as the one used
here. Their analysis illustrated how the diffusion of different web
technologies and practices follow an S-shaped pattern as well as the
different diffusion rates of the different technologies and practices.

For instance, we can approximate digital economic activities in a region
by measuring the volume of commercial webpages by considering only
.co.uk websites, which are dedicated to commercial activities (Thelwall,
2000). Such commercial websites are used to exchange information,
support online transactions and share opinions (Blazquez \& Domenech,
2018). Although nothing prevents a UK-based company from adopting a
generic TLD such as.com and, indeed, such cases escape our data, we do
not expect that such omissions could affect our results given the
popularity of the .uk ccTLD: UK consumers prefer to visit a .uk website
when they are searching for products or services (Hope, 2017); and
anecdotal evidence indicates that during the first half of 2000, three
.co.uk domains were registered every minute (OECD, 2001). Also, as Table
1 demonstrates, .co.uk was the most popular SLD under the .uk ccTLD in
2000. Hence, we use the total volume of all the archived webpages in a
region as a proxy for the level of digitization. We start the analysis
by focusing on commercial webpages (.co.uk).
