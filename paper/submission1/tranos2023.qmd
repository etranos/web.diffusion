  This paper maps the participation in the digital economy and its evolution in the UK over space and time. Most of the existing economic geography literature which dealt with the spatiality of the internet employed supply-side measures, such as infrastructural capacity, in order to understand the geography of the digital economy and its potential spatial economic effects. Useful as these approaches might have been, they cannot capture the micro-processes and the characteristics of the individual online behaviour. Using large volumes of archived and geolocated web content, this paper models the diffusion of web technologies over space and time in the UK. The data and geolocation strategy allow to capture these processes at a very granular spatial scale. The modelling approach, which is based on simple spatial analytical methods and on the estimation of diffusion curves at various scales, enables to depict the role of geography and other cognitive factors which drove the diffusion of web technologies. Although the focus is on a recent historical period -- 1996-2012 -- the results of the analysis depict diffusion mechanisms which can be very useful in understanding the evolutionary patterns of the adoption of other newer technologies.

# Introduction {#sec1}

Geographers were always interested in how new technologies and
innovations diffuse across space and, importantly, how such
spatio-temporal processes can be modelled. After all, diffusion together 
with invention and innovation are considered the pillars of 
technological change [@das2022diffusion]. The seminal contribution of
@hagerstrand1968innovation is illustrative of this early interest.
However, the torch of exploring and modelling such processes had been
passed to other disciplines such as economics, business studies and
sociology well before the 'cultural turn' of economic geography
[@perkins2005international]. A potential explanation of the lack of 
geographical studies exploring the diffusion of new and, more 
specifically, digital technologies across *both* space and time can be
attributed to the scarcity of relevant and granular enough data. As 
@zook2022mapping highlight, digital activities are hardly ever captured 
in official data.

This paper offers such a contribution: a geographical study illustrating 
how a new technology that is the web diffused over space and time 
in the UK at a high level of spatial granularity during the $1996-2012$ 
period. It does so by employing a novel source of big data which 
captures the active engagement with web technologies during that period.
By addressing this empirical question this paper exemplifies how the 
combination of data sources which escape the traditional social science
domain and adequate research methods can offer new contributions 
regarding our understanding of technologies are diffused.

The motivation for this paper lies in the fact that there are various
stakeholders who are interested in knowing how new digital technologies
diffused over space and time and use this information to make predictions
regarding the diffusion of related *future* technologies.
As per @leibowicz2016representing, historical studies agree on the fact that 
"technologies diffuse at different times, at different rates, and to
different extents in different places, and can be significantly
influenced by policies [@victor1993]". @meade2021modelling highlight that 
a variety of actors have a direct interest in gaining such knowledge 
including network equipment suppliers; network operators, regulatory 
and local authorities. 
These processes and their effects very a lot between scales: although
the diffusion of a new technology might not be optimal at a local level,
it might be beneficial from a global perspective as it might enable 
faster diffusion to less advantaged places @leibowicz2016representing. 
Despite the spatial heterogeneity of such diffusion mechanisms and 
the policy relevance, there are very limited attempts in the literature 
to analyse the diffusion of new digital technologies at a detailed 
geographical level. 


<!-- diffusion and adoption -->

Technological diffusion, which is by definition an aggregated process, 
can be discussed in parallel with individual adoption mechanisms.
On the one hand, @rogers2010diffusion identifies early adopter of new 
technologies as 'knowledgeable risk takers' and @griliches1957 as 'profit 
maximisers' [@ding2010modeling]. Such individual agents are rewarded because 
of their attitude towards new technologies and innovations. On the other hand,
@perkins2011internet attribute diffusion to two processes: (i) epidemic-type 
of mechanisms, which 

Two main mechanisms are identified in the
literature to explain diffusion: (1) epidemic-type dynamics whereby
contact with previous adopters stimulates uptake as po tential adopters
learn about a new innovation; and (2) economic-type mechanisms whereby
potential users adopt a new innovation as it be comesmore profitable,
useful, or valuable, with uptake characteristically spreading as costs
be come lower, performance improves, or the po tential uses of the
innovation grow over time.
The criticisms are mainly based on the fact that although the approach
gives an idea of aggregate (industry or household) behaviour, it does
not focus on the individual's (firm or household) adoption process

@morrill2020spatial understands spatial diffusion as the landscape 
changes that spread across space because of changes that take place 
elsewhere. 



<!-- data and early engagement with the web -->

wilson201281 Early on in their lifecycle, new technologies are crude,
imperfect, and expensive (Rosenberg, 1994). New energy technologies are
attractive for their ability to perform a particular task or deliver a
new or improved energy service (Fouquet, 2010). This is often
circumscribed by a particular set of needs in a particular context: a
market 'niche'. End-users in niche markets are generally less sensitive
to the effective price of the energy service provided or have a higher
willingness to pay for its performance advantages (Fouquet, 2010). Thus
initially, performance dominates cost competitiveness (Wilson and
Grubler, 2011). Market niches afford some protection from competitive
pressures, allowing technologies to be tested and improved in applied
settings, reducing uncertainties with performance or market demand (Kemp
et al., 1998). Costs may only fall substantively after an extended
period of commercial experimentation, concurrent with the establishment
of an industrial base and characteristic moves towards standardisation
and mass production (Grubler, 1998). The influence of accumulating
production experience on costs is captured by the concept of learning.

@perkins2005international Theoretical models disagree as to why firms
adopt innovations at different times. Epidemic models emphasize
information (Griliches 1957). Certain firms are hypothesized to adopt
earlier because they come into contact with, and learn from, adopters of
the new technology before others. Economic models, on the other hand,
predominantly emphasize firm heterogeneity (Ireland and Stoneman 1986).
Firms adopt technologies at different times because they differ with
respect to various organizational and environmental variables
influencing the economic returns from adoption (Blackman 1999).

<!-- methods -->

@grubler1990rise Later Hagerstrand conceptualized physical "barrier"
effects like lakes or uninhabited areas, which, in addition to distance,
act as further retarding effects on diffusion. These are formalized in
the form of "zero" or "half" contact multiplicators on the (distance
decaying) message flows.

@grubler1990rise With respect to the formalization of the communication
flows Hagerstrand defines a "mean information field" (MIF), in which the
probability of communication is a negative function of distance between
individuals





<!-- methods -->

@wilson201281 Logistic growth describes an initial period of gradual
diffusion as a technology is introduced as a new commercial application,
moving then through a rapid, exponential growth phase, before slowing
and eventually saturating [@grubler1999dynamics]. The substitution of
incumbent technologies by new competitors leads to subsequent decline
and eventual obsolescence.

# Literature review {#sec2}

MAYBE SKIP THIS??

<!-- previous studies -->

@beardsell1999spatial To characterize evolution of the computer
industry, we examine the distribution of relative employment across
cities in 1977 and how that distribution changes over time to 1992

There is no tendency of relative size distributions of urban computer
employment to collapse, go bimodal, or fully spread. Overall computers
exhibit some turbulence, with dramatic big winners and losers among
cities. In attracting or repelling an industry, urban heterogeneity is
important. Large, well educated cities near San Jose have much greater
chances of attracting high-tech employment and less of losing it

@bednarz2020pulled spatial innovation diffusion By using Bayesian
survival models with time-dependent data of wind turbine deployment and
firm foundation for 402 German regions between the years 1970 and 2015,
we show that the spatial evolution of the German wind energy industry
was more strongly influenced by local demand-- pull than local
supply--push processes.

The industry's initial locations are distributed relatively arbitrarily
and unpredictably, as their needs in terms of resources and skills are
diverse and distinct from the older existing industries (Boschma and
Lambooy, 1999). Consequently, emerging industries are characterized by
relatively high degrees of freedom in terms of location. In later
extensions of the concept, the assumption of the randomness of locations
was revised with greater importance assigned to regional conditions
(Boschma and Lambooy, 1999; Fornahl et al., 2012).

@perkins2005international analyze whether the rate at which new producer
technologies diffuse is significantly influenced by (1) latecomer
advantage and (2) engagement with the global economy via trade and
foreign investment

Indeed, precisely because of these latecomer advantages, developing
countries1 are believed to be well placed to catch up with developed
ones (Gerschenkron 1962; Abramovitz 1986).

@fritsch2015new analyze the spatial diffusion of laser technology
research in West Germany from 1960, when this technology began, until
2005.

@perkins2011internet

@lengyel2020role We see that the OSN spread almost exclusively from the
original location (the capital Budapest, with an order of magnitude more
inhabitants than the next size town) to various parts of the country in
the early phase of the life-cycle. Later, diffusion became less
mono-centric and other towns also emerged as spreaders. Our findings
support the idea that spreading initially happens to large distances and
becomes more local over time. This is illustrated and discussed later in
Figure 2I.

@PAPAGIANNIDIS2015308

@leibowicz2016representing for energy There is no generally accepted
theory that explains diffusion rate heterogeneity across technologies,
but several factors are considered important. Greater unit scale and
larger market size contribute to slower diffusion. Requirements for
interrelated technologies or complex infrastructures also hinder the
diffusion process (Grubler, 2012).

Mobile phones benefited from early deployment in recreational boats and
automobiles, where the traditional competitor was not a viable option.
In the early stages of diffusion, performance is a more important driver
of adoption than cost competitiveness. Typically, significant cost
reductions only occur once the technology reaches a deployment level
capable of supporting standardization and mass production (Wilson,
2012).

@leibowicz2016representing Empirical evidence supports the validity of
Schmidt's Law over a wide range of technologies, time periods, and
geographical contexts. A recent meta-analysis of technology up-scaling
found that diffusion accelerated moving from the core to the rim and
periphery for technologies as diverse as natural gas power, oil
refineries, and automobiles (Wilson, 2009). One historical example that
conforms particularly well to Schmidt's Law is the diffusion of coal
power in Europe (Grubler, 2012). England emerged as the core region for
coal power because it had legal and economic institutions that
incentivized scientific pursuits, domestic coal reserves, and a clear
industrial motivation to replace water power with coal. ...

@ding2010modeling model the spatial diffusion of mobile
telecommunications in China as well as its determinants. regional
socioeconomic characteristics play an important role in determining the
timing, speed, and level of mobile telecommunications diffusion in China

@bento2018time explore What determines the duration of formative phases
for energy innovations in different markets? We are interested both in
initial markets (also: core, lead, first mover, early adopter) where
formative phases prepare technologies for mass commercialization, and in
follower markets (also: periphery, lag, late adopter) where accelerated
formative phases may benefit from diffusion and spillovers.

@perkins2005internationalEither way, the strong assumption is that developing countries can
acquire modern technology innovated in developed economies, often at a
fraction of the original research and development (R&D) costs, thereby
leapfrogging many decades of technological progress (Teece 2000).

@perkins2005international The first involves a country's geographical location. Recent empirical
work suggests that diffusion is ''geographically localized'' (Globerman,
Kokko, and Sjo¨holm 2000; Keller 2002; Milner 2003) in that a technology
diffuses faster in a country where it is already more widely diffused in
neighboring countries. Underlying these regional effects are contagion
and contact with prior users or producers of technology.


# Materials and Methods {#sec3}

@wilson201281 growth function description in p. 86

from R: Asym/(1+exp((xmid-input)/scal)) using the terms from Wilson
k/(1 + e\^(t_0 - t)/scal)

Wilson: k(1 + e\^-b(t - t_0)) So, scal = - 1/b

The curve is symmetric\* around t_0

**minimum R2 = 95%**, see also @grubler1990rise

The literature usually uses the saturation level as the asymptote. I am
using the total number of websites as we cannot compute a rate.

Moran's I as @ding2010modeling **TODO** for t_0, diffusion speed

## Results {#sec3.1}

Hexagon density maps: reflect the spatial structure of Britain. Websites
are associated in places where people live and work.

**TODO** maps at the local authority level per firms and discuss
patterns

Neighbourhood effect: diffusion proceeds outwards from innovation
centers, first "hitting" nearby rather than far-away locations (Grubler
1990)

-   Moran's I: for OA and LAD over time **TODO** add 0s

-   LISA maps: for OA and LAD over time More and less expected clusters.
    Different scales show different results

-   Website density regressions: for OA and LAD over time **TODO** add
    0s Similar pattern

Hierarchy effect: from main centers to secondary ones -- central places

-   Gini coefficient. Almost perfect polarisation of web adoption in the
    early stages at a granular level More equally diffused at the Local
    Authority level Plateau overtime

S-shaped diffusion curves

-   S for LADs per firm and OA. **TODO**: OA per firm? fix firms over
    time.

-   Fast and slow LAs map. There is clustering

-   **TODo** check s_uk_firm_11

-   ranks: there is stability and movement
