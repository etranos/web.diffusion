Dear Editors,

This paper aims to renew economic geography’s interest in the diffusion of emerging technologies. Economic geographers were traditionally interested in how new technologies and innovations diffuse across space, but the torch of exploring and modelling such processes had been passed to other cognate disciplines well before the 'cultural turn' of economic geography. The lack of adequate, granular data has been cited as a reason for the decreased research interest, especially for new digital technologies.

To address this gap, this paper uses a novel dataset depicting commercial website density in the UK at very granular spatial scales. It builds a robust methodological framework based on Machine Learning to test the capacity of spatial diffusion mechanisms in predicting the diffusion of the Web. The analysis covers the period from 1996 to 2012, capturing the Web’s development from its early stages to maturity. The exploratory analysis illustrates, for the first time, how well the established S-pattern of cumulative adoption fits at the local scale as well as instances of notable stability, but also volatility of web diffusion, which are indicative of leapfrogging. Then, the robust modelling framework demonstrates the remarkably good predictive power of different spatial diffusion mechanisms even at fine geographical scales and also their spatial heterogeneity.

The paper directly contributes to the economic geography field. The adoption of digital technologies is associated with longstanding economic gains even at local scales. Therefore, understanding how digital technologies diffuse over space and time is vital in mapping future economic trajectories of places. Although the focus is the UK, the empirical framework is transferable to other geographical contexts.

I confirm that the manuscript has been submitted solely to this journal and is not published, in press, or submitted elsewhere.
