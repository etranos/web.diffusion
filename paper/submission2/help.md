## Zook 2001
used domain name registration addresses
primarily static mapping
1998 +correlation between .com domain registration and business registration even at postcode level
went down to city level

> Future research using time series data on domains per country and city, will be able to provide further elaboration of the causes behind internet's growth and diffusion.

## Zook 2000
Mine does not suffer from multiple registrations
went down to urban scale
some comparisons 1993-98

> Although the drop in location quotients for cities outlined in figure 4 indicates a reduction in some of the Internet's initial concentrations it is still too early to see whether production of Internet content will ever reach a point of product standardization.

My paper shows that this happened and is visible at different scales.

## Moss and Townsend 1997
mapping a domain database
their database only includes headquarters. Not my data.

## Gorman 2002
This paper examines the head and branch locations of the top 40 e-business integration firms in the USA
