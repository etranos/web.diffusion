    abstract = {Sea level rise in the United States will lead to large scale migration in the future. We propose a framework to examine future climate migration patterns using models of human migration. Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration, driven by sea level rise, differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically, we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections, creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive, expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration, and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States.},

	abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all variable events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

@article{Farag2007,
abstract = {Searching product information and buying goods online are becoming increasingly popular activities, which would seem likely to affect shopping trips. However, little empirical evidence about the relationships between e-shopping and in-store shopping is available. The aim of this study is to describe how the frequencies of online searching, online buying, and non-daily shopping trips relate to each other, and how they are influenced by such factors as attitudes, behaviour, and land use features. Questionnaire data were collected from 826 respondents residing in four municipalities (one urban, three suburban) in the centre of the Netherlands. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the variables' multiple and complex relationships. The results show that searching online positively affects the frequency of shopping trips, which in its turn positively influences buying online. An indirect positive effect of time-pressure on online buying was found and an indirect negative effect of online searching on shopping duration. These findings suggest that, for some people, e-shopping could be task-oriented (a time-saving strategy), and leisure-oriented for others. Urban residents shop online more often than suburban residents, because they tend to have a faster Internet connection. The more shopping opportunities one can reach within 10 min by bicycle, the less often one searches online.},
